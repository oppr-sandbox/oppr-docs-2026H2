Doc and library scope were correct, but asset scope answered from the right slice while searching the wrong one — a library-wide vector search post-filtered to linked docs, which lost recall (the asset's docs had to rank in the global top 30 to be seen at all) and made the cross-link 'Not linked' badge unreachable dead UI. Fixed: asset scope resolves its linked documents first and filters the vector search to them at the index level (or(eq(documentId,…)), capped 64), with an explicit library-wide fallback that fills to k and flags the extra sources 'Not linked' so the operator still gets an answer and the missing link is visible. Archived docs no longer answer asset/library questions; library top-k 3→5. Plus three chat fixes the screenshots caught: the text-size dial did nothing (size class was overridden three layers down — now inherits, small step is 11px for more text per screen), the [1]/[5]/[6] citation chips were unexplained (now a Sources-header note + per-chip tooltip), and the cross-link popover dropped its pre-Convex 'Reset demo' copy.

Root cause named: the css-size+overflow canvas is the wrong model. Decision 1 (load-bearing): replace it with a fixed-pixel SVG viewport + a single <g transform='translate(panX,panY) scale(zoom)'> — pan by drag, zoom in AND out freely (fit is a button not a floor), clientToWorld = (clientX−svgLeft−panX)/zoom, add-shape lands at the viewport centre so it's always visible. Decision 2: background becomes a placeable/resizable/lockable element { url,x,y,w,h,locked } instead of the thing that sizes the canvas. Consolidation: 'Start from' → 'Import template' dropdown with Background image… as an entry; palette buttons become drag sources. Scope guard: no new capabilities beyond drag-and-drop + background-as-element; the v3 surface is the surface.

Build approach: hand-rolled SVG canvas (React Flow rejected — it renders DOM, fights the SVG export; mermaid kept as overrun escape hatch; AI-raw-SVG rejected for safety). The synthesis recommendation: AI drafts the model, the human refines it in the canvas. v1 scope cut: connectors are straight / simple-elbow with no obstacle avoidance (the hand-roll time-sink).
